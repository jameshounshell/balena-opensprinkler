# Balena-OpenSprinkler (raspberry pi)

The open Sprinkler is an open source hardware ecosystem for microcontrollers (arduino esp8266) and single board computers (Raspberry Pi, BeagleBoneBlack)

This repository builds a docker container for the [Balena.io](balena.io) ecosystem which includes all the boards in the BeagleBone and Raspberry pi product families.

TODO:

add node-red container to build to act as an API for the OpenSprinkler.
